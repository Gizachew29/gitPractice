To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. 

If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and 
gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.
